UMB-Thesis-Template
===================

A Latex template for the UMB Thesis. This can be used for both, Masters and Ph.D.

Although it is not required to use this template: Included in this project are the .project and .texlipse files for TeXlipse using Eclipse which are explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfQ2U2kG4Wg


Start by editing the sample latex document <code> umb-thesis.tex </code>

You can compile on the command line using <code>pdflatex umb-thesis.tex </code> to generate a new umb-thesis.pdf file. If you are using TeXlipse when you save a new pdf file will be generated automatically.
